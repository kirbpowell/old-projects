# Robotics Projects

Most of these projects were made while I was a master's student.

### Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT)

bounded-unbounded-rrt.py shows off the RRT algorithm. It has predetermined input, and finds a path from a given starting point to a given destination. Once it's found a viable path from start to end it will display a graph showing all explored points, all obstacles it encountered, and the highlighted path it's chosen.

### Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

ekf-example.py is, as it says on the tin, an example of the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm.
